Introduction   
The  IT  sector  of  Sri  Lanka  continues  to  grow  every  year,  yet  many  graduates  struggle  to  align  their  
skills
 
and
 
job
 
applications
 
with
 
current
 
industry
 
demands.
 
Candidates
 
are
 
forced
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
scattered
 
set
 
of
 
disconnected
 
tools,
 
such
 
as
 
Canva
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
CV,
 
Jobscan
 
to
 
check
 
for
 
keywords,
 
LinkedIn
 
to
 
find
 
job
 
listings,
 
and
 
the
 
Google
 
interview
 
platform
 
to
 
practice
 
generic
 
interview
 
questions.
 
This
 
current
 
state
 
of
 
affairs
 
is
 
not
 
only
 
cumbersome
 
but
 
also
 
dampens
 
the
 
job
 
search
 
process.
 
Recent
 
advances
 
in
 
multi-agent
 
AI
 
systems
 
enable
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
stateful,
 
coordinated
 
agents
 
capable
 
of
 
executing
 
multi-step
 
workflows.
 
This
 
project
 
applies
 
these
 
advances
 
in
 
an
 
academic
 
context
 
to
 
explore
 
how
 
agent
 
orchestration
 
and
 
semantic
 
reasoning
 
can
 
improve
 
personalised
 
career
 
guidance,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
Agent-to-Agent
 
(A2A)
 
protocol
 
for
 
structured
 
inter-agent
 
communication.
 
Problem  Statement  
Current  digital  career  tools  suffer  from  four  key  limitations:  
1.  Fragmentation:  Feedback  from  CV  analysis  is  not  reused  during  interview  preparation  or  skill  
planning.
 2.  Semantic  Limitations:  Many  tools  rely  on  keyword  matching  rather  than  understanding  
relationships
 
between
 
skills
 
and
 
roles.
 3.  Stateless  Interaction:  User  progress  and  historical  feedback  are  lost  between  sessions.  4.  Limited  Contextual  Awareness:  Tools  rarely  incorporate  up-to-date,  local  labour-market  data.  
As  a  result,  candidates  receive  repetitive  and  generic  advice  that  does  not  evolve  with  their  goals  or  
performance.
 
Scope  and  Limitations  The  project  will  deliver  a  functional  prototype  that  demonstrates  coordinated  multi-agent  behaviour  
for
 
career
 
development
 
tasks.
 
Core
 
functionality
 
focuses
 
on
 
text-based
 
CV
 
analysis,
 
semantic
 
matching,
 
and
 
career
 
guidance.
 
Advanced
 
components
 
such
 
as
 
real-time
 
speech-based
 
interview
 
interaction
 
and
 
enhanced
 
security
 
guardrails
 
are
 
treated
 
as
 
stretch
 
objectives.
 
The
 
system
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
candidate
 
use
 
only
 
and
 
is
 
not
 
intended
 
for
 
production
 
deployment.
 
Real-time
 
market
 
data
 
relies
 
on
 
public
 
job
 
listings,
 
which
 
may
 
undergo
 
structural
 
changes
 
over
 
time.
  Expected  Impact  and  Stakeholders  The  AI  Partner  for  Career  Development  is  designed  to  transform  the  job-seeking  process  from  a  
fragmented
 
task
 
into
 
a
 
cohesive,
 
context-aware
 
journey.
 
By
 
integrating
 
Multi-Agent
 
Systems
 
(MAS),
 
the
 
project
 
aims
 
to
 
reduce
 
"application
 
fatigue"
 
and
 
improve
 
the
 
"Semantic
 
Match
 
Score"
 
between
 
candidates
 
and
 
industry
 
requirements.
 
The
 
primary
 
direct
 
stakeholders
 
are
 
final-year
 
undergraduates,
 
recent
 
graduates,
 
and
 
interns
 
who
 
utilise
 
the
 
platform
 
for
 
personalised
 
CV
 
optimisation
 
and
 
low-latency
 
interview
 
coaching.
 
The
 
indirect
 
stakeholders
 
include
 
University
 
Career
 
Guidance
 
Units
 
(CGUs)
 
seeking
 
scalable
 
support
 
tools,
 
IT
 
recruiters
 
looking
 
for
 
industry-ready
 
talent,
 
and
 
academic
 
examiners
 
evaluating
 
the
 
project's
 
technical
 
rigour.
 
According
 
to
 
Ransbotham
 
et
 
al.
 
(2025),
 
such
 
agentic
 
systems
 
move
 
beyond
 
simple
 
automation
 
to
 
provide
 
stateful,
 
long-term
 
career
 
2  
  
planning.  Ultimately,  this  project  seeks  to  bridge  the  national  "skills  gap"  identified  by  SLASSCOM  
(2024),
 
providing
 
a
 
high-impact,
 
AI-driven
 
blueprint
 
for
 
modern
 
career
 
architecture.
  
Business  Case 
2.1  Business  Need  Manual  job  preparation  is  time-consuming  and  inefficient,  where  candidates  often  tailor  CVs  through  
trial
 
and
 
error
 
without
 
clear
 
insight
 
into
 
how
 
employers
 
evaluate
 
applications.
 
This
 
leads
 
to
 
misaligned
 
skill
 
development
 
and
 
reduced
 
confidence
 
due
 
to
 
continuous
 
rejections.
 An  integrated  system  that  combines  CV  analysis,  job  matching,  and  interview  preparation  can  
significantly
 
reduce
 
preparation
 
effort
 
and
 
also
 
improve
 
the
 
relevance
 
of
 
feedback.
 
By
 
utilising
 
the
 
A2A
 
Protocol,
 
this
 
system
 
solves
 
the
 
isolation
 
problem,
 
allowing
 
agents
 
to
 
fetch
 
external
 
market
 
data
 
without
 
any
 
user
 
intervention.
 
2.2  Business  Objectives  The  project  aims  to:  Increase  Efficiency :  Reduce  the  time  required  for  CV  tailoring  and  interview  preparation  by  70%  
through
 
automated,
 
personalised
 
feedback
 
generated
 
by
 
the
 
CV
 
Optimiser
 
Agent.
 Improve  Alignment :  Improve  the  "Semantic  Match  Score"  between  candidate  skills  and  job  
requirements
 
by
 
atleast
 
25%
  
using
 
GraphRAG
 
analysis
 
rather
 
than
 
keyword
 
matching.
 Validate  Architecture :  Evaluate  the  robustness  of  a  multi-agent  architecture  by  analysing  system  
behaviour
 
under
 
partial
 
agent
 
failure
 
conditions,
 
which
 
aims
 
to
 
maintain
 
99%
 
session
 
integrity.
  
Project  Objectives 
3.1  Functional  Deliverables   ADK  Orchestrator :  A  coordinator  agent  implemented  using  Google  ADK  (Python  SDK)  to  manage  
workflows
 
(SequentialAgent,
 
RouterAgent)
 
and
 
maintain
 
session
 
state
 
via
 
the
 
Interactions
 
API.
 Specialist  Agent  Mesh:  A  set  of  specialised  agents  for  CV  critique,  semantic  matching,  career  
guidance,
 
and
 
market-trend
 
analysis.
 A2A  Communication  Layer :  An  implementation  of  the  Agent-to-Agent  (A2A)  protocol  enabling  
structured
 
task
 
delegation
 
between
 
agents
 
(e.g.,
 
on_message_send
 
for
 
task
 
handoffs).
 GraphRAG  Engine:  A  skill  reasoning  component  utilising  the  ESCO  ontology  stored  in  Neo4j  to  infer  
implicit
 
skills
 
(e.g.,
 
"React"
 
implies
 
"JavaScript").
 Native  Audio  Interview  Coach :  An  interactive  agent  using  Gemini  2.5  Flash  Native  Audio  via  
WebSocket
 
for
 
real-time,
 
low-latency
 
speech-to-speech
 
mock
 
interviews.
 
3.2  Quality  Criteria   Performance :  Text-based  analysis  responses  returned  within  10  seconds.  Audio  latency  must  be  
under
 
500ms
 
to
 
ensure
 
natural
 
conversation.
 
3  
  
Reliability :  Agent  failures  do  not  terminate  the  entire  workflow,  and  the  ADK  Coordinator  must  
handle
 
exceptions
 
and
 
offer
 
fallback
 
options.
 Privacy :  Personally  identifiable  information  (PII)  is  removed  client-side  using  Transformers.js  before  
cloud
 
processing.
 
3.3  Success  Metrics   Match  Improvement:  Quantitative  improvement  in  cosine  similarity  scores  between  baseline  and  
optimised
 
CV–job
 
description
 
pairs
 
across
 
a
 
controlled
 
test
 
set.
 Usability:  Positive  feedback  from  student  testers  regarding  the  naturalness  of  the  Interview  Coach's  
voice
 
and
 
the
 
relevance
 
of
 
the
 
CV
 
suggestions.
 Workflow  Completion:  Successful  execution  of  multi-agent  workflows  (e.g.,  CV  Analysis  ->  Market  
Lookup
 
->
 
Interview
 
Prep)
 
without
 
loss
 
of
 
state.
 
Literature  Review 
Recent  research  indicates  a  significant  shift  from  stateless  chatbots  to  stateful  multi-agent  
architectures
 
capable
 
of
 
long-term
 
planning
 
and
 
coordination
 
(Ransbotham
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025).
 
Frameworks
 
such
 
as
 
Google
 
ADK
 
and
 
LangGraph
 
have
 
emerged
 
as
 
the
 
standard
 
for
 
defining
 
these
 
"state
 
machines"
 
where
 
agents
 
possess
 
distinct
 
roles
 
and
 
persistent
 
memory.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
information
 
retrieval,
 
traditional
 
keyword-based
 
matching
 
is
 
increasingly
 
replaced
 
by
 
embedding-based
 
approaches
 
like
 
Sentence-BERT
 
(SBERT),
 
which
 
report
 
higher
 
accuracy
 
in
 
aligning
 
CVs
 
with
 
job
 
descriptions
 
(Sankar
 
et
 
al.,
 
2021).
 
However,
 
newer
 
studies
 
on
 
GraphRAG
 
(Graph-based
 
Retrieval
 
Augmented
 
Generation)
 
suggest
 
that
 
vector-only
 
search
 
often
 
fails
 
to
 
capture
 
complex
 
professional
 
hierarchies,
 
proposing
 
knowledge
 
graphs
 
as
 
a
 
superior
 
method
 
for
 
mapping
 
"skill
 
trees"
 
and
 
career
 
trajectories
 
(Edge
 
et
 
al.,
 
2024).
 
A  critical  emerging  theme  in  recent  years  is  the  transition  from  human-centric  Identity  and  Access  
Management
 
(IAM)
 
to
 
Agent-centric
 
Security.
 
As
 
multi-agent
 
systems
 
proliferate,
 
the
 
industry
 
has
 
identified
 
a
 
"Looming
 
Authorisation
 
Crisis"
 
where
 
traditional
 
human-session
 
protocols
 
fail
 
to
 
secure
 
autonomous,
 
ephemeral
 
agents
 
(ISACA,
 
2025).
 
Recent
 
research
 
from
 
the
 
Cloud
 
Security
 
Alliance
 
(2025)
 
emphasises
 
that
 
AI
 
agents
 
often
 
operate
 
as
 
Non-Human
 
Identities
 
(NHIs),
 
which
 
now
 
vastly
 
outnumber
 
human
 
users
 
in
 
the
 
enterprise.
 
This
 
necessitates
 
a
 
shift
 
toward
 
Zero
 
Trust
 
Architecture
 
for
 
agents,
 
where
 
every
 
request
 
is
 
authenticated
 
and
 
authorised
 
through
 
robust
 
Machine-to-Machine
 
(M2M)
 
authentication
 
and
 
just-in-time
 
(JIT)
 
credentials
 
rather
 
than
 
static
 
API
 
tokens
 
(CyberArk,
 
2026).
 
Key
 
strategies
 
highlighted
 
in
 
the
 
recent
 
2026
 
playbooks
 
include
 
Zero
 
Standing
 
Privileges
 
(ZSP),
 
ensuring
 
agents
 
only
 
possess
 
the
 
permissions
 
necessary
 
for
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
a
 
specific
 
task
 
(Prefactor,
 
2025).
 
Despite  these  advancements,  a  critical  analysis  of  existing  literature  reveals  a  persistent  
"Orchestration
 
Gap."
 
While
 
individual
 
studies
 
explore
 
CV
 
analysis,
 
job
 
matching,
 
or
 
interview
 
bots
 
in
 
isolation
 
(Swain
 
&
 
Malik,
 
2025),
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
a
 
holistic,
 
candidate-facing
 
pipeline
 
where
 
these
 
components
 
share
 
a
 
persistent
 
user
 
context.
 
Most
 
academic
 
prototypes
 
are
 
designed
 
as
 
"black-box"
 
optimisation
 
tools
 
for
 
recruiters
 
rather
 
than
 
collaborative,
 
stateful
 
"co-pilots"
 
for
 
job
 
seekers
 
(Zhang
 
et
 
al.,
 
2024).
 
Furthermore,
 
while
 
advancements
 
in
 
real-time
 
multi-modal
 
feedback
 
and
 
agentic
 
4  
  
learning  loops  exist,  they  are  rarely  integrated  into  a  closed-loop  agentic  workflow  that  continuously  
adapts
 
system
 
behaviour
 
based
 
on
 
user
 
performance
 
and
 
contextual
 
requirements,
 
particularly
 
in
 
candidate-centric
 
career
 
development
 
scenarios
 
(Cai
 
et
 
al.,
 
2025).
 
The  implications  of  this  review  for  the  current  project  are  clear:  while  the  individual  technical  
components
 
for
 
an
 
AI
 
career
 
co-pilot
 
are
 
maturing,
 
the
 
primary
 
research
 
frontier
 
lies
 
in
 
the
 
seamless
 
integration
 
and
 
stateful
 
management
 
of
 
these
 
tools.
 
This
 
project
 
addresses
 
the
 
identified
 
gaps
 
by
 
utilising
 
LangGraph
 
to
 
manage
 
a
 
"Coordinator
 
Agent"
 
that
 
maintains
 
context
 
across
 
fragmented
 
tasks,
 
from
 
CV
 
optimisation
 
and
 
local
 
market
 
scraping
 
to
 
real-time
 
speech-based
 
interview
 
coaching.
 
By
 
implementing
 
the
 
A2A
 
(Agent-to-Agent)
 
Protocol
 
and
 
incorporating
 
an
 
"Adversarial
 
Debate"
 
pattern
 
for
 
iterative
 
refinement
 
(Chan
 
et
 
al.,
 
2024),
 
this
 
project
 
moves
 
beyond
 
isolated
 
tools
 
toward
 
a
 
fully
 
integrated,
 
candidate-centric
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
bridges
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
theoretical
 
research
 
and
 
practical
 
career
 
preparation.
 
The  data  for  the  comparative  analysis  in  the  table  below  is  synthesised  from  a  cross-evaluation  of  the  
industry
 
standards
 
and
 
empirical
 
research
 
discussed
 
throughout
 
this
 
review.
 
Specifically,
 
the
 
architectural
 
distinction
 
between
 
monolithic
 
LLMs
 
and
 
the
 
proposed
 
Multi-Agent
 
System
 
(MAS)
 
is
 
grounded
 
in
 
the
 
shift
 
toward
 
stateful,
 
role-based
 
workflows
 
identified
 
by
 
Ransbotham
 
et
 
al.
 
(2025).
 
The
 
transition
 
from
 
simple
 
semantic
 
similarity
 
to
 
GraphRAG-driven
 
"Skill
 
Trees"
 
is
 
supported
 
by
 
the
 
structural
 
advantages
 
of
 
knowledge
 
graphs
 
documented
 
by
 
Edge
 
et
 
al.
 
(2024)
 
and
 
the
 
matching
 
accuracy
 
benchmarks
 
of
 
Sankar
 
et
 
al.
 
(2021).
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
security
 
parameters
 
for
 
Agent
 
IAM
 
and
 
Zero
 
Trust
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
emerging
 
risk
 
frameworks
 
established
 
by
 
ISACA
 
(2025)
 
and
 
CyberArk
 
(2026)
 
regarding
 
the
 
management
 
of
 
Non-Human
 
Identities.
 
Finally,
 
the
 
advancements
 
in
 
interviewing
 
capabilities,
 
specifically
 
the
 
move
 
toward
 
native,
 
low-latency
 
audio,
 
directly
 
address
 
the
 
"Orchestration
 
Gap"
 
and
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
closed-loop
 
feedback
 
loops
 
identified
 
in
 
the
 
critical
 
analyses
 
of
 
Zhang
 
et
 
al.
 
(2024).

5.1  Research  Design  The  project  follows  a  Design  Science  Research  (DSR)  methodology,  iteratively  designing,  
implementing,
 
and
 
evaluating
 
the
 
proposed
 
system.
 
Development
 
follows
 
Agile
 
principles
 
with
 
two-week
 
sprints,
 
allowing
 
for
 
regular
 
refinement
 
of
 
agent
 
behaviours
 
based
 
on
 
testing.
 The  development  will  commence  with  a  backend-first  approach,  prioritising  the  engineering  of  
specialised
 
agents
 
for
 
CV
 
critique,
 
generation,
 
and
 
market
 
analysis
 
using
 
the
 
Gemini
 
API.
 
This
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
a
 
multi-modal
 
interview
 
agent
 
leveraging
 
Gemini
 
Flash’s
 
native
 
audio
 
capabilities.
 
A
 
centralised
 
RAG
 
architecture
 
will
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
a
 
vector
 
database
 
to
 
provide
 
the
 
agents
 
with
 
domain-specific
 
knowledge.
 
Integration
 
will
 
be
 
managed
 
by
 
a
 
central
 
Orchestrator
 
utilising
 
the
 
A2A
 
protocol
 
for
 
seamless
 
agent
 
communication,
 
secured
 
via
 
an
 
Agent-specific
 
IAM
 
framework.
 
The
 
project
 
will
 
culminate
 
in
 
a
 
Next.js
 
frontend
 
integration,
 
with
 
a
 
rigorous
 
testing
 
phase
 
employing
 
Jest,
 
Mocha,
 
and
 
Pytest
 
to
 
ensure
 
functional
 
and
 
performance
 
benchmarks

Risk  Analysis  
Table  3:  Risk  Analysis  Table  
Risk  Likelihood  Impact  Mitigation  Strategy  
Agent  Orchestration  Complexity:  Agents  may  get  stuck  in  infinite  loops  or  fail  to  hand  off  tasks  correctly  via  A2A.  
High  High  
Use  ADK's  LoopAgent  primitives  with  strict  max_iterations  limits.  Implement  a  "Supervisor"  logic  to  kill  stuck  processes.  
Scope  Creep  (Frameworks):  Rapid  updates  to  Google  ADK  or  Gemini  models  (e.g.,  API  deprecations)  may  break  code.  
Medium  Medium  
Freeze  core  library  versions  early  in  development.  Use  the  Vertex  AI  Agent  Engine,  which  abstracts  some  infrastructure  changes.  
9  
  
Latency  (Audio):  Real-time  audio  via  WebSockets  depends  on  network  stability.  
Medium  High  Use  Gemini  2.5  Flash  Native  Audio,  which  is  optimised  for  streaming.  Implement  a  "Push-to-Talk"  fallback  if  network  latency  exceeds  500ms.  
Data  Privacy:  Potential  leakage  of  PII  to  the  LLM.  
Low  High  Implement  Client-Side  Redaction  using  transformers.js  to  strip  emails/phones  before  the  API  call  is  made.
